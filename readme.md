# LAlib readme

## Hello

This is the readme for my Linear algebra library called LAlib.

This is the sole programmer for the library, Derek Mandl.  I am writing this library primarily for learning reasons, and for practice, and also to use in a program I will write in the future codenamed compass.

Though I made it primarily for my own reasons, I have absolutely no problem with somebody else using it for their own purposes so long as they obey the rules outlined in the license.  The lisence is very straightforward so that shouldn't be too hard.

I also have no problem with constructive input or feedback, but I am mainly doing this for my own learning so please keep that in mind.  i.e. please do not do large ammounts of work for me because that will not help in the long run.

This is being built on Ubuntu v16.04

the .h file and the .cpp file are the entire library, basically.  I also have a .error file, which houses error codes, just incase you are not sure why my functions are not behaving

You can also use the makefile if you wish, it was written to build a program for debugging, so you will have to update it if you wish to use it for your program.

It is fully finished now, so what you see is what you get.
