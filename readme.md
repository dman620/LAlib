# LAlib readme

## Hello

This is the readme for my Linear algebra library called LAlib.

This is the sole programmer for the library, Derek Mandl.  I am writing this library primarily for learning reasons, and for practice, and also to use in a program I will write in the future codenamed compass.

Though I made it primarily for my own reasons, I have absolutely no problem with somebody else using it for their own purposes so long as they obey the rules outlined in the license.

At the time of the first commit to this repo, the library is in a very early state of completion.  I only have the base classes defined.  I mainly just commited this so that I can view it from multiple places.

That being said, as I write more I will add to this readme.
