01 - order mismatch:
   the order of a matrix is the (number of rows X number of collumns).
   this error means that matrices were operated on with mismatching orders.
   this could occur in multiple areas:
   -Perhaps you tried to multiply two matrices that do not qualify for matrix multiplication.
   -Perhaps you tried to fill a matrix with matrices that do not have a matching number of rows.
   -Perhaps you tried to do another operation to two matrices that do not have the correct relative orders to do the operation.

02 - invalid bounds:
   the bounds of a function are reversed.  i.e. the lower bound is higher than the upper bound.
   -Perhaps you specified invalid bounds while using the fillMatrixR function.

03 - file not found:
   the file specified does not exist.
   You have attempted to open a file that does not exist.

04 - expected integer:
   a function expected an integer, and it got something that is not an integer.
   -perhaps you have a stray string in a fill function's arg list or a constructor's arg list.
